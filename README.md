### R-Force Fitness app
This is an app that helps you plan your fitness sessions and add them to a calendar. It is built using Laravel in combination with Livewire, and SQLite for the database. The app allows the admin to add exercises with the help of a console command, which can then be combined by the user to create a training program and add the training programs to a calendar. It was intended to be used in a real-life project, but because the client didn't continue with the project, more advanced functionalities haven't been added to the app. Future additional adjustments could include: implementing roles for trainers, allowing users to access each other's profiles, allowing workout sessions to be marked as completed.
